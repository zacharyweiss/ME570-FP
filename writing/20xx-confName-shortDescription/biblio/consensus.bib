@inproceedings{Kokiopoulou:06,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes an algorithm for distributed
                 classification, based on a SVM scheme. The contribution
                 of each support vector is approximated by low complexity
                 distributed thresholding over sub-dictionaries, whose
                 union forms a redundant dictionary of atoms that spans
                 the space of the observed signal. Redundant dictionaries
                 allow for sparse representation of the observed signal,
                 hence a good approximation of the support vector
                 contributions, which is moreover robust to noise. The
                 algorithm is applied to distributed image classification,
                 in the context of handwritten digit recognition in a
                 sensor network. The experimental results indicate that
                 the proposed method is capable of achieving the same
                 classification performance as the standard (non
                 distributed) SVM, with an increased resiliency to noise.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~A highly accurate algorithm, based on support vector machines formulated as linear programs (Refs. 1--2), is proposed here as a completely unconstrained minimization problem (Ref. 3). Combined with a chunking procedure (Ref. 4), this approach, which requires nothing more complex than a linear equation solver, leads to a simple and accurate method for classifying million-point datasets. Because a 1-norm support vector machine underlies the proposed approach, the method suppresses input space features as well. A state-of-the-art linear programming package (CPLEX, Ref. 5) fails to solve problems handled by the proposed algorithm. },

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of network anomaly detection in large distributed systems. In this setting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a method for discovering anomalies by continuously tracking the projection of the data onto a residual subspace. This method was shown to work well empirically in highly aggregated networks, that is, those with a limited number of large nodes and at coarse time scales. This approach, however, has scalability limitations. To overcome these limitations, we develop a PCA-based anomaly detector in which adaptive local data filters send to a coordinator just enough data to enable accurate global detection. Our method is based on a stochastic matrix perturbation analysis that characterizes the tradeoff between the accuracy of anomaly detection and the amount of data communicated over the network. 1},

@article{Li:06,
	Abstract = {With the growing use of large-scale sensor networks, huge volumes of sensor data are being generated from structural health monitoring systems. Vibration sensor data often constitute a large portion of the monitoring data from a structural health monitoring system. Efficient transmission and management of large-size vibration sensor datasets are becoming an increasingly important aspect of structural health monitoring systems. To address this problem of emerging importance, this paper presents a novel method for interactive retrieval and management of sensor network data. Pre-defined features obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) are proposed for the detection of changes in the monitored structure. The PCA transform and linear predictor are also used in the data compression scheme to allow users to retrieve data progressively with significantly reduced data size. The results of a case study involving wireless sensor network data collected from a five-story model building are presented to demonstrate the potential use of the proposed method in the transmission and management of sensor network data. The proposed method is believed to provide data users with the flexibility to select data and retrieve data at multi-resolution levels, reducing raw data size, relaxing the communication bandwidth requirement, and speeding up the data transmission process.},

	Abstract = {Consider a group of individuals who must act together as a team or committee, and suppose that each individual in the group has his own subjective probability distribution for the unknown value of some parameter. A model is presented which describes how the group might reach agreement on a common subjective probability distribution for the parameter by pooling their individual opinions. The process leading to the consensus is explicitly described and the common distribution that is reached is explicitly determined. The model can also be applied to problems of reaching a consensus when the opinion of each member of the group is represented simply as a point estimate of the parameter rather than as a probability distribution.},

	Abstract = {We study the convergence speed of distributed iterative algorithms for the consensus and averaging problems, with emphasis on the latter. We first consider the case of a fixed communication topology. We show that a simple adaptation of a consensus algorithm leads to an averaging algorithm. We prove lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for various classes of linear, time-invariant, distributed consensus methods, and provide an algorithm that essentially matches those lower bounds. We then consider the case of a time-varying topology, and provide a polynomial-time averaging algorithm.},
